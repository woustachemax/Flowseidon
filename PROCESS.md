# Development Process Log

## Day 1: Project Foundation & Core Setup

Initialized a Next.js project with Turbopack for faster development builds and integrated shadcn/ui for the component library. Set up a PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM, defining the initial schema and creating a `lib/db.ts` file with a Prisma singleton pattern to prevent multiple client instances during hot reload. Added Code Rabbit for automated code reviews. Configured tRPC following the official [documentation](https://trpc.io/docs/client/tanstack-react-query/server-components) to establish end-to-end typesafe APIs with TanStack React Query for server component integration. Integrated Better Auth as the authentication provider and designed the authentication pages for login and signup functionality.
